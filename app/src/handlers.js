/**
 * Resolver handlers, with every dependency injected.
 *
 * `resolvers.js` binds these to Forge (`@forge/api`, `@forge/kvs`, the resolver
 * framework). The tests bind them to a fake Jira and an in-memory store that
 * implements the same conditional commits, and drive the same code through the
 * same paths. That is deliberate: it means the vertical slice has actually been
 * executed end to end, and the only thing not proven is whether Atlassian
 * behaves as expected — which no amount of local testing can prove.
 *
 * P2.2 adds the management lifecycle to this file. Track and untrack are no
 * longer a list edit: both move an issue through `initializing`, write the
 * state the workflow condition reads, and only then settle on `managed` or
 * `unmanaged`. Every step is verified by reading it back, and a step that fails
 * leaves the issue `initializing` — withheld, not open.
